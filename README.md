# project-find-and-replace-starter

We are developers on a team building a custom spreadsheet app for a local company to display customer data.
We recently started development, so not all the features are present yet!
But we do have some basic spreadsheet code already written.

Today, you have accepted a task to add a basic "find & replace" feature to our app.
